        <p>Project on console</p>
        <p>Visual studio is basically Brackets but more complex and from what I can tell, better</p>
        <p> To open up the consol screen right click on the website and select "Inspect" then go to the console menu. You can print anything on the console menu by adding the "console.log(write somthing)" function.</p>

        <script>

            var first_name ="Ashok";
            console.log(first_name);

            var last_name ="Shanbhag";
            console.log(last_name);

            var full_name = first_name.concat(last_name);
            console.log(full_name);

            var a = 238;

            var b = 578;

            var add = a+b;
            console.log(add);

            var subtract = a-b;                     
            console.log(subtract);

            var multiply = a*b;
            console.log(multiply);

            var divide = a/b;
            console.log(divide);
                
        </script>
